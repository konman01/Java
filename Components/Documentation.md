### What are the difference between Abstract Class and Interface?
|Abstract Class|Interface|
|--------------|---------|
| Methods in the Abstract class can be a method having the implmentation or Abstarct Method | All the methods defined in an Interface are Abstarct Method |
| We can define the access specifier for the methods in the Abstarct class as default, protected or public | All the methods in an Interface is public |
|Abstarct class does not support multiple Inheritance | Interface can extends multiple interfaces |
| Abstract classes will have Constructors | Interfaces does not have Constructors |
| The data members can have any access specifiers | The data members in a class by default static final and public.|
