### What is Spring Container

Spring container is the core of Spring Framwork. It creates and manage complete lifecycle of an Object (Invertion Control) and injects objects dependencies(Dependency Injection). The container gets its instructions on what objects to instantiate, configure, and assemble by reading the configuration metadata provided. The configuration metadata can be represented either by XML, Java annotations, or Java code. 

### What is spring Bean?

When Java objects are created by the Spring Container, then Spring refers to them as "Spring Beans".

### What is Inversion Control

It is an approch of outsourcing the construction and management of objects. 

### What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection in a practice where we create objects saperately and injects its dependency during runtime instead of constructing them constructing them internally.
